    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D. is a Master of the Mystic Arts. Originally a brilliant but 
       arrogant neurosurgeon, Strange got into a car accident which resulted in his hands becoming crippled. Once 
       Western medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj, where he was trained by the Ancient 
       One in the ways of Magic and the Multiverse. Although he focused on healing his hands, Strange was drawn into 
       a conflict with Kaecilius and the Zealots, who were working for Dormammu and had sought to merge Earth with the
       Dark Dimension. Following the demise of the Ancient One and the defeat of Kaecilius, Strange then became the new 
       protector of the Sanctum Sanctorum, seeking to defend the Earth from other inter-dimensional threats.</p>
